  description: >
    Under the guidance of the manager agent, analyze each requirement against the proposal outline to determine compliance status. The analysis process should:

    1. Initial Analysis Phase:
       - Review all requirements and outline sections
       - Identify key elements and patterns in requirements
       - Map potential relationships between requirements and outline sections

    2. Detailed Matching Phase:
       For each requirement:
       - Analyze the requirement statement to understand its intent and key elements
       - Search through the proposal outline sections and subsections to find matching content
       - For each potential match:
         * Compare the requirement with the section/subsection content
         * Determine if the content adequately addresses the requirement
         * Assess if any additional context or information is needed

    3. Compliance Determination Phase:
       - Make a compliance determination:
         * Pass: If the requirement is fully addressed in the outline
         * Fail: If the requirement is not addressed or inadequately addressed
       - Provide clear justification for the compliance status
       - Map the requirement to the relevant section(s) in the outline

    4. Validation Phase:
       - Review all compliance determinations for consistency
       - Ensure all requirements have been analyzed
       - Verify justifications are clear and well-supported
       - Confirm proper mapping of requirements to outline sections

    Requirements to analyze: {requirements}
    Proposal outline: {outline}
