    After completing ALL validation searches above, you MUST generate and return ONLY valid JSON.
    DO NOT return search results, summaries, or explanations.

    STEP 1: Execute all validation searches
    STEP 2: Analyze findings from all previous tasks
    STEP 3: Generate ONLY the JSON structure below
    STEP 4: Return PURE JSON with no additional text

    REQUIRED JSON FORMAT (EXACT STRUCTURE):

        "federal_compliance_verified": true
      }
    }

    MUST return ONLY valid JSON in the exact format specified above.
    NO additional text, explanations, or markdown formatting.
    NO search result summaries or OpenSearch outputs.
    PURE JSON ONLY that validates against federal instruction template standards.

    If no sections are found from previous tasks, return:
    {

        "total_subsections": 0,
        "federal_compliance_verified": false,
        "error": "No sections discovered in RFP analysis"
      }
    }
